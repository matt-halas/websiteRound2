# Biking from Calgary to Vancouver - Week 1

In November 2020, after one (1) month of snow, I was dreaming of summer. Unfortunately, since it was only November, I'd have to wait 5 months before it would be nice and warm out again. So until then, my only option was to experience summer vicariously through youtube videos. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3O3ooTtrV4" target="_blank">This video</a> came up on my feed so I watched it over the course of a few days while eating lunch. The Great Divide Mountain Bike Route (Banff, AB to the Mexico border) has been on my bucket list for a couple years and this video seemed to capture the experience so well. After watching the video, I knew I wanted to do a similar trip in the summer. So I started planning and I started dreaming of the upcoming trip!
## The Route
I've never done a bikepacking trip before so I wasn't about to make the GDMBR my first trip. I wanted to do something big though, so I browsed [bikepacking.com](https://www.bikepacking.com){:target="_blank"} for inspiration. After a road trip through southern BC in the previous year, I was wanting to go back, so the [BC Trail](https://bikepacking.com/routes/bc-trail/){:target="_blank"} seemed like a great choice! After some more searching, I found that the [Trans Canada Trail](https://tctrail.ca/explore-the-map/){:target="_blank"}(TCT) overlaps with the entire BC Trail, so I based my route off that. I decided I would leave from my house in Calgary, AB, and finish my trip at Stanley Park in Vancouver, BC.

## Planning and Gear
I read somewhere on Reddit that the best bike for bikepacking is the bike you own. I own two bikes, a Jamis Ventura road bike, and Trek Fuel mountain bike. I should have listened, but I was dead set on using a hardtail for this trip since most bikepacking videos I've seen had only hardtails or rigid bikes. My friend has a hard tail that he hasn't used for a while, so he let me borrow his Giant Talon.
<img src="static/website/bikeTripImages/talon-pre-trip.jpg" alt="The Giant Talon" width="80%"/>
<p style="text-align: center;"><i>The Giant Talon Packed up on Day 1</i></p>
Originally, I wanted to use a panier for the extra storage space, but the mounting would be a pain to set up so I went with the ol' reliable saddle bag. I also bought a frame bag (small enough to leave space for a water bottle), top tube bag (waterproof for electronics), and a dry bag for the handlebars. I wish I got a picture of all my gear layed out before packing (those pictures are so cool!), but I'll make sure to get that for my next trip.

I didn't want to hold myself to a schedule, so I got a good idea of where I could camp along the route and planned to stop whenever I felt that I had enough for the day. I carried a sat phone with me that I could use to check in with me mum whenever I was starting/stopping for the day.

## Day 1 - Calgary to Bragg Creek (71 km)
My friend Austin joined me for the first day, so after leaving, I biked the familiar route between our houses to pick him up. It was about 35<sup>o</sup>C when I left, so walking into Austin's air conditioned home after 20 minutes of biking made me reconsider what I was about to do. I quickly pushed that thought aside, helped Austin load up his bike, and we were on route to Bragg Creek! The route I chose for this day deviates from the Trans Canada Trail, as I didn't want to go all the way north to Cochrane just to come back down south to Bragg Creek. This was the only day that was 100% road, so I chose the least busy roads between Calgary and Bragg Creek and took those.

This route took us through rural communities and hilly ranchlands. Very hilly ranchlands. We made distance a bit slower than expected but finally made it into Bragg Creek as dusk was creeping in. We still had light to set up the tent, but we ate in the dark. I spent a good 20 minutes trying to get the bear hang set up, but after that, we were out.

## Day 2 - Bragg Creek to Barrier Lake (52 km)
The sun shining through the tent wall makes it quite difficult to sleep in. So even if we could've used a few more hours of sleep, we packed up and headed over to the town of Bragg Creek for breakfast.

<p style="text-align: center;"><i>Our campsite on the morning of the 2nd day</i></p>
I wouldn't have another spot to get food until well into day 3, so I stocked up on peanut butter, canned tuna, chocolate, pepperoni, and any other dense foods I could find. Austin biked with me to the West Bragg Creek trailhead and we waited for his mom to pick him up there. From this point on, I'd be leaving the road and biking on trails.

<p style="text-align: center;"><i>Me and Austin hanging out at West Bragg Creek</i></p>
I was starting to get a little nervous about being on my own on the trails here, but excitement took over once I got biking. There were some super muddy sections of the trail here which made the travelling extremely slow.

<p style="text-align: center;"><i>The Tom Snow trail in Bragg Creek</i></p>
The official TCT goes over Cox Hill, which would add another 900m of elevation to my already tired legs, so I chose to ride around it instead. I still had to go up a pass to get to Barrier Lake, and after a few hours of pushing my bike through mud and up hills, I found I was taking breaks every 5 minutes until I had to eventually sit down. This made me realize I barely ate anything since breakfast and this was but a "bonk". I had a few spoons of peanut butter, read for 15 minutes, and I was good to go again! I got to the top of Lusk Pass, the trail started to flatten out, and I was getting excited for the downhill. Then my back wheel went over a rock, slipped, and I found I could not pedal anymore.

<img src="static/website/bikeTripImages/rip-derailleur.jpg" alt="Tom Snow trail" width="60%"/>
<p style="text-align: center;"><i>The poor derailleur</i></p>
Oh lordy. This was not good. The derailleur was completely trashed. I tried running the chain through just the front chainring and cassette, but with no tension from the derailleur, it kept slipping as I went over bumps on the downhill. I kept imagining what I'd do to get myself out of this and keep the trip going. Canmore was still so far away and there's no way I'd do that entire stretch on one gear with a chain that slips every minute. I contemplated quitting a couple of times. But after calming down, and thinking the situation through, I decided that the Giant Talon would be a no-go for the rest of the trip. I asked me mum to bring my Trek Fuel to Barrier Lake, 45 mintues outside of Calgary. Luckily, she was okay with it. The trip was saved! While waiting at Barrier Lake, I ate some dinner, went for a swim, and had an hour to relax after all that happened. I moved all my bags over to the new bike, asked a biker in the parking lot for a shock pump to make up for the extra weight of the bags, and was off to find a campsite on the south side of Barrier Lake.

## Day 3 - Barrier Lake to Banff (55 km)
I woke up excited that the trip could continue, and had myself a healthy and nutritious breakfast of chocolate and peanutbutter. A few foxes passing through my campsite joined me for breakfast too!

<img src="static/website/bikeTripImages/day3-fox.jpg" alt="Fox joining me for breakfast" width="40%"/>
<p style="text-align: center;"><i>One fox from the fleet</i></p>
After breakfast, I got up and back down Jewell Pass without too much hassle. The section of trail alongside the Trans-Canada Highway gave me lots of hassle though. No amount of bug spray would deter the mosquitos, and with the amount of steep sections that involved me getting off my bike and stopping for a breather, they had plenty of opportunities to bite my arms and legs.

<img src="static/website/bikeTripImages/day3-stairs.jpg" alt="Fox joining me for breakfast" width="80%"/>
<p style="text-align: center;"><i>The trail along the Trans-Canada Highway had plenty of these stairs. Pushing a 60lb bike up these stairs was a bit of a challenge</i></p>
After plenty of hike-a-biking, I made it to Canmore! I was craving a burger and fries so I headed straight for the Don's. Once again, the AC made me question why I was doing this to myself and once again I quickly pushed that thought aside. Starting on the Canmore to Banff paved pathway, I noticed a distressing grinding noise coming from my back wheel. I kept getting off my bike, trying to diagnose it but no matter what I tightened, it would keep going. I shrugged it off and decided I'd deal with it when I got to Banff. The grinding kept getting worse and worse, and soon became accompanied with a wobble. I pulled over, took the back wheel off, and tried to take apart the hub to see what the issue was. Nothing stuck out, and no matter how much I tried to tighten it, the hub still wobbled. I hobbled into Banff with the wheel screeching every rotation by the time I stopped for the day. Lucky for me (I got lucky lots this trip), I was planning on staying with my friends in Banff for two nights, so the extra day gave me plenty of time to deal with the wheel issue. I got referred to this local legend, 'Dave', who was the community bike mechanic for the town of Banff. He took a look at the wheel for me, and told me the hub would need to be rebuilt with new parts, which would take quite some time to get ordered in. He said a new wheelset was my best bet at continuing this trip. After the day prior, I was determined not to let anything stop me so I called every bike shop in the area till I found a shop in Canmore that had the wheelset I was looking for. $300 later, the trip was saved yet again! Dave wouldn't take any money or gifts for his help, but instead told me to buy his friend in Fernie some chocolate. I had a quest and I wasn't going to let Dave down!

## Day 4 - Banff to Somewhere in the Spray Valley (50 km)
While getting breakfast in Banff before starting on one of the more remote sections of the trip, I met a guy named Joe who was doing the same trip as me, but in the opposite direction. This was super reassuring since the smoke from wildfires was pretty bad this season. Seeing someone else on this route made me feel more confident about pressing through the smoke. The Goat Creek Trail paired with the High Rockies Trail in the Spray Valley gave this day some of the best biking in the entire trip.

<p style="text-align: center;"><i>Pic of me after biking down once, setting up a gopro, walking back up, and biking down again</i></p>
While in the Spray Valley, I ran into a couple on a mountain bike ride, said hi, and biked by. 5 minutes later, I heard someone yell 'hey!' from behind me. I looked back, and it was the guy I just passed. He then asked if my name was Matt. I asked how he knew, and his girlfriend said I seemed like a Matt when I biked by. His name was Dave (I asked for his name, unfortunately I didn't guess), and him and his girlfriend visit from Ontario every year to bike this trail. He then invited me to bike ~200km from Banff to Fernie with him later in the summer. The bike ride never happened but I was intrigued! That whole interaction was super weird but I had something to think about for the rest of the day. I came upon a backcountry campsite with bear lockers once my legs started to tire, so I set up camp there, and watched the sunset from my hammock.

<img src="static/website/bikeTripImages/day4-chillin.jpg" alt="Action shot!" width="80%"/>
<p style="text-align: center;"><i>The extra weight and space that the hammock took up was definitely worth it</i></p>
There was the occasional car that visited the day use area, but as the sun set, everyone packed up and left, and for the first time this trip, I'd be sleeping completely alone in the middle of nowhere. This started out as distressing but slowly became peaceful instead after thinking of all the precautions I was taking to avoid wildlife. I had a storage bin far away from my tent for my food and I had bear spray and the sat phone with me in the tent. Before sleeping, I took one last walk around the site to watch the last bit of sunlight leave the sky.

***Note: In the first bit of the trip, my activity recordings are quite segmented and don't include the entire day because I didn't use the 'resume later' feature on my watch. it gets better!***

## Day 5 - Somewhere in the Spray Valley to Elkford (130 km)
This day had a ton of great views so it's a bit of a photo dump.

I was woken up by the sound of footsteps in the morning, so I got out of my sleeping bag, trying to make as little noise as possible, and peeked out of the tent. I was greeted with this elk about 30m away just trotting through the parking lot!

<p style="text-align: center;"><i>Who needs alarms</i></p>
It was time to pack up, I wanted to get an early start since I had a long day ahead. I took some time to have breakfast by the pond.

<img src="static/website/bikeTripImages/day5-morningducks.jpg" alt="" width="60%"/>
<p style="text-align: center;"><i>Misty morning!</i></p>
At this point, I felt like I really nailed packing up the bike. My hubris was quickly dampened after I looked back and saw the drawstring on the top of my saddlebag was snapped and my flip-flops were missing. Luckily I only had to go back 1 km to find both flip-flops. I secured them a little better, then I was on my way. Aside from that small hiccup, this morning was incredibly peaceful.

<img src="static/website/bikeTripImages/day5-bike.jpg" alt="" width="80%"/>
<p style="text-align: center;"><i>'Makeout Point'</i></p>
The climbs were manageable and the descents were flowy, even with bags strapped to the bike. After about three hours of riding, I finally saw other bikers doing the same trail so I joined them for a bit.

<img src="static/website/bikeTripImages/day5-bridge.jpg" alt="" width="50%"/>
<p style="text-align: center;"><i>I walked my bike across this</i></p>
After this super wobbly bridge, I had a super fun descent to the Kananaskis Lakes, where I took a 2 hour lunch break. It felt good to cover 35km before noon.

<img src="static/website/bikeTripImages/day5-view.jpg" alt="" width="80%"/>
<p style="text-align: center;"><i>View right before Kananaskis Lakes</i></p>
According to my map, I had roughly 70km left, with 10km of climbing followed by 60km of descent. The climb up elk pass was wonderful, it was very lush and green.

<p style="text-align: center;"><i>The butterflies really liked my gloves!</i></p>

The top of the pass had this gateway built, which marked the Alberta-British Columbia border.

<p style="text-align: center;"><i>I'm in BC, the camera is in AB</i></p>

The next 5km of the trail was one of the most memorable moments of the trip. Since I was so high up, the views were much more grand.

<img src="static/website/bikeTripImages/day5-elkvalley2.jpg" alt="" width="80%"/>
<p style="text-align: center;"><i>The Elk Valley is absolutely beautiful!</i></p>

I had this view to look at while I travelled 30 km/h effortlessly going downhill. I had to stop a few times to savour the view since I knew it wouldn't last. After this main downhill, the rest of the valley was a bit of a slog. I was finishing the last bit of the food I had while realizing I severely miscalculated the distance between Kananaskis Lakes and Elkford. Instead of the 100km day I was expecting, I was in for 130km. I grit my teeth through the last bit of the valley dreaming of the food I'd get once in Elkford. When I rolled into town however, every restaurant was closed! I forgot small towns tend to close down early. Luckily, the liquor store was still open and carried snacks, so after biking 130km, I scarfed down a bag of chips and a few pieces of jerky.

## Day 6 - Elkford to Fernie (80 km)
I woke up starving after the previous day, but unfortunately, the town of Elkford doesn't do breakfast so I had more chips to start the day. For the first time during this trip, the heat wasn't terribly oppressive and the sun was shielded by the clouds.

<img src="static/website/bikeTripImages/day6-road.jpg" alt="" width="60%"/>
<p style="text-align: center;"><i>I usually hate overcast, but the clouds were appreciated</i></p>

I gunned it to Sparwood to get myself a nice burger, the first real meal for a couple of days. The burger raised my spirits a little but while I was taking a super long lunch break, the sun came back out and the temperatures soared again. That definitely slowed down the second half of this day. Sparwood and Fernie are connected by a 40km length of wonderful singletrack, so even if it was hot, the trail was fun.

<img src="static/website/bikeTripImages/day6-building.jpg" alt="" width="80%"/>
<p style="text-align: center;"><i>Idk what this building was for but there was a basement I didn't feel brave enough to explore</i></p>

<img src="static/website/bikeTripImages/day6-view.jpg" alt="" width="80%"/>
<p style="text-align: center;"><i>The trail under the powerlines didn't have much shade so I took very frequent breaks</i></p>

When I got into town I had some fish and chips and stocked up on food. I stayed at the Mt Fernie provincial park and although I had to pay for a site, the showers were much needed and the bear bins gave me peace of mind.

## Day 7 - Fernie to Kikomun Creek Prov. Park (80 km)
I've been here before for mountain biking and I was floating the idea of going for a morning bike ride without my bags on the nearby trails. But after waking up with sore legs, I let the idea slide and went on with the trip instead. I headed into town and had some Big Bang Bagels for breakfast/lunch (very good bagels btw), and waited for the chocolate shop to open so I could complete Dave's quest of delivering chocolate to Jay. At the chocolate shop, I asked for recommendations and crowd favorites since it was for a gift. After hearing that, the shop owner asked if it was for Jay! So I got recommended Jay's favorite chocolate and brought it to him at the bike shop next door. After that, I was on my way out of Fernie. The trails near the town were super flowy and well maintained. I got a warned of a black bear up the trail from an oncoming biker so I kept my eyes and ears open for the next little bit. A little bit of rain started to fall which was very welcome as it cleared a bit of the smoke out of the sky. About an hour out of the town, I came upon a dog standing in the middle of the path ahead, looking right at me.

<img src="static/website/bikeTripImages/day7-dog.jpg" alt="" width="80%"/>
<p style="text-align: center;"><i>The lone scout dog</i></p>

I stopped for a bit and it eventually went back along the path so I continued on. After turning a corner, I heard a bunch of barking and I saw at least 10 dogs all looking at me, wagging their tails. I stopped on the side of the trail to say hi to all the dogs as the owner walked by.

The trails started getting rougher as I got further from Fernie and the single track eventually kicked me out onto a combination of logging and fire roads. I took a break in Elko to get some sugary drinks and snacks. Right after Elko, the vegetation changed drastically. The leaf filled green forests were replaced by dry yellow grass and Jack Pines. I saw that there was a campsite in the Kikomun Creek Provincial Park so I made that my destination for the day. I set up camp right next to Lake Koocanusa, had my freeze dried dinner that I picked up in Fernie, and read in my hammock till the sun set.
