# Biking from Calgary to Vancouver - Week 3

## Day 15 - Arlington Lakes to Chute Lake (75 km)
I got an early start to the day and tried to pack quietly to not wake up the other campers. I was packed up and biking as the sun was rising over the lake.

<p style="text-align: center;"><i>Arlington Lake(s) again</i></p>

It didn't take long before my butt started to hurt again, so I switched between biking fast and taking breaks for most of the day. I was quite excited to reach the Myra Canyon, I biked through it a few years ago during a trip to Kelowna and it was beautiful.

<p style="text-align: center;"><i>I'm 100 meters in the air!</i></p>

Myra Canyon was pretty crowded but that was welcome after seeing no one for the past four hours. I took my time going through the canyon trying to soak it all in. After the canyon, the amount of people quickly dropped and I was on my own again. This part of the trail was quite dry and dusty, so I needed to lube my chain almost every 30 km.

<p style="text-align: center;"><i>Just a sturdy and stable looking post</i></p>

I was trying to remember why I took a picture of this post. Normally I flip my bike over when I need to oil the chain, but with all the bags, that was not an option. So I thought this post would be a great spot to lean the bike while I applied the oil. Instead, the bike just knocked it down and I stood there for a good minute wondering why I didn't just use a tree.

<p style="text-align: center;"><i>Lake Okanagan, more like Lake Smokanagan</i></p>

I had an amazing view into the Okanagan from this part of the trail, but it was completely blanketed in smoke, so I couldn't even see the lake. It wouldv'e been such a great view! When I had service, I scouted out the route ahead for spots to eat and restock, and the Chute Lake Lodge came up. It was about 20 km from the end of Myra Canyon so I was motivated to bike fast by the thought of restaurant food.

<p style="text-align: center;"><i>I'm glad my coca-cola addiction only lasted the length of this trip</i></p>

The food was amazing, and the lodge gave me a spot to charge my batteries and fill my water. I was thinking of taking a day of rest and this was the perfect spot. There was a rec site with camping right next to the lodge, so I stayed there because $300 a night was a little steep. So instead, I justified spending extra at the restaurant with the money I wasn't spending for a room. I took the next day off to relax and swim, which was much needed for my sore butt.

## Day 16 - Chute Lake to Osprey Lakes (105 km)
After a day of rest I was itching to continue with the trip, so I got an early start to the day. Once again, I was trying to be quiet while packing but tents are inherently loud, so the family camping on the neighboring site had an early morning as well. On the trail, about 10 km away from Chute Lake, I heard some rustling downhill from me and saw a black bear running away as I passed. First bear of the trip!

<img src="static/website/bikeTripImages/day16-ponderosa.jpg" alt="" width="60%"/>
<p style="text-align: center;"><i>I became a little obsessed with ponderosa pines after seeing this one, I am yet to find out what they smell like</i></p>

Chute lake was a high point along the KVR, so from here to Penticton was smooth sailing and fast. Instead of the switchbacks along the rail grade, I opted for a singletrack shortcut straight down the hill. Unfortunately, this shortcut meant I missed a tunnel but I didn't figure out until I passed it and I did not feel like back tracking 5 km up a hill.

<img src="static/website/bikeTripImages/day16-vineyards.jpg" alt="" width="80%"/>
<p style="text-align: center;"><i>The trail eventually wound right beside a couple vineyards</i></p>

Oh boy was it smoky today. The forecast called for pretty bad smoke for the next three days so I was expecting it, but I was still a little dissapointed. I couldn't see the big views into the valley, but the vineyards I could see in Naramata were still nice. Someone left a hose next to the trail, so I filled up on water that I didn't need to filter or treat. 

<img src="static/website/bikeTripImages/day16-smoke.jpg" alt="" width="80%"/>
<p style="text-align: center;"><i>More forest between Naramata and Penticton</i></p>

The one benefit of the smoke was that it blocked the sun, so the heat was bearable. At Penticton, I got some coffee and a muffin, and made another stop at a farmers market I was passing by. I picked up a bunch of peaches, and continued onto Summerland. Summerland rivals Nelson for hilliest town. It didn't help that I forgot to make a stop at the grocery store and had to back track. Leaving Summerland, I realized I went through the Okanagan without buying any wine so I found a winery, and made a stop there. I tasted a few dessert wines and bought a bottle for later.

<img src="static/website/bikeTripImages/day16-bridge.jpg" alt="" width="80%"/>
<p style="text-align: center;"><i>The rail over this bridge was still operational so I watched a tour group go across it</i></p>

After Summerland, the trail became more remote once again. There were some properties along the road however, so I wasn't completely alone.

<img src="static/website/bikeTripImages/day16-cows.jpg" alt="" width="60%"/>
<p style="text-align: center;"><i>Cows are much more comforting to see than bears</i></p>

The trail from Summerland was very sandy. That paired with my butt hurting again meant I was taking a lot of breaks. I was on a good book at the time so I didn't mind stopping every 30 minutes to read. When I stopped for one of my breaks, I saw another black bear on the other side of the river that ran away after seeing me. The sandy trail got on my nerves eventually so I biked along the gravel road instead.

<p style="text-align: center;"><i>A general store at this campsite would've been very nice but I survived</i></p>

I was planning on making it to Princeton but the climb out of Summerland took it out of my legs, so I stayed at Osprey Lakes instead. The Osprey Lakes were a little cooler than the Arlington Lakes so I spent much less time swimming today.

<p style="text-align: center;"><i>Part of a healthy and nutritious dinner</i></p>

I had to ask around for a corkscrew because I didn't think of how I'd get the wine open when I bought it. I had no service here so there wasn't much to do but read then go to sleep.

## Day 17 - Osprey Lakes to Princeton (49 km)
The smoke was still lingering in the morning. I think this day was the worst in terms of the smoke. I got a late start and didn't have much of a goal in mind. I just wanted to take it easy and not push myself too hard through the smoke.

<img src="static/website/bikeTripImages/day17-bankier.jpg" alt="" width="80%"/>
<p style="text-align: center;"><i>The building in the back used to be a general store</i></p>

I was really hoping the town next to my campsite would have a general store or a cafe, but there was only a building that looked like it used to be one. So I continued down towards Princeton without coffee.

<img src="static/website/bikeTripImages/day17-road.jpg" alt="" width="80%"/>
<p style="text-align: center;"><i>The smoke and lack of people made this stretch quite eerie</i></p>

It was probably the smoke, but even though I was going downhill and haven't travelled very far, I was struggling a lot today. Once I got closer to Jura, the trees opened up and the foothills began, which reminded me a lot of southern Alberta. The trail wound through some ranchland, and I ran into some farm critters.

<img src="static/website/bikeTripImages/day17-sheep.jpg" alt="" width="80%"/>
<p style="text-align: center;"><i>These sheep lived up to their stereotype, as soon as one decided to be scared of me, the rest followed</i></p>

I don't know if they were supposed to be on this side of the fence, but they ran as far as they could away from me and watched me suspiciously as I passed. Once I got to Princeton, I found a cafe and got my much needed coffee and lunch. After lunch, a light rain began. The air quality was still quite bad, and was predicted to be bad until the next afternoon. After how difficult the short and downhill day was, I decided to relax in Princeton for the remainder of the day. I shopped around for motels, and got some dinner to take back to my room. I watched Office Space, Groundhog Day, then chatted with friends and got a new book on my e-reader for the rest of the trip. After almost a week of no motels, the bed was nice!

## Day 18 - Princeton to Hope (146 km)
I had three cinnamon buns, a full pot of motel coffee, and I was ready to get the day started! I had a huge day planned ahead of me but I got out of the motel a little later than planned. About 20 minutes out of Princeton, the smoke was clearing, and the sun started beaming through.

<img src="static/website/bikeTripImages/day18-tulameen.jpg" alt="" width="80%"/>
<p style="text-align: center;"><i>I was loving all the gates along the trail</i></p>

At Tulameen, I got the worst value chicken sandwich I have ever purchased, or ever will purchase. It was essentially a junior chicken from mcdonalds, but it was $15. It was tasty, but still, bad value. I have nothing against Tulameen because of that sandwich though, the town was beautiful. After taking a wrong turn, getting lost, and wandering through neighborhoods, I was on my way out of Tulameen and heading towards the Coquihalla.

<img src="static/website/bikeTripImages/day18-sign.jpg" alt="" width="60%"/>
<p style="text-align: center;"><i>I guess the trip is over, gotta turn back</i></p>

At this point, the smoke was about 10% as bad as it was the day before, and I was loving the sun and the views.

<img src="static/website/bikeTripImages/day18-fence.jpg" alt="" width="60%"/>
<p style="text-align: center;"><i>Trying to not get stabbed by barbed wire was pretty fun</i></p>

I was biking through a lot of ranchlands and had to get off my bike to open and close gates quite often.

<img src="static/website/bikeTripImages/day18-brookmere.jpg" alt="" width="80%"/>
<p style="text-align: center;"><i>Blue sky is back!</i></p>

I was so happy to be out of the worst of the smoke! The biking is so much more pleasant when you're not engulfed in a smoke that makes everything around grey. I continued up through Brookmere and connected to the section of the TCT that runs along the Coquihalla highway.

<img src="static/website/bikeTripImages/day18-fires.jpg" alt="" width="80%"/>
<p style="text-align: center;"><i>I'm very thankful none of the trail was closed due to the fire, biking along the Coquihalla would be a little spooky</i></p>

<img src="static/website/bikeTripImages/day18-coquihala.jpg" alt="" width="80%"/>
<p style="text-align: center;"><i>The small roads along the Coquihalla don't get a whole lot of traffic</i></p>

<img src="static/website/bikeTripImages/day18-valley.jpg" alt="" width="80%"/>
<p style="text-align: center;"><i>Coasting effortlessly down this valley was a trip highlight</i></p>

I was starting to kick myself a little for leaving so late this morning, getting to the Coquihalla summit took me much longer than I expected, and I had 60 km to clear before sunset, which was in 3 hours. I was also quite worried about wildlife since this section of trail took me far from the highway, but I made plenty of noise with my music.

<img src="static/website/bikeTripImages/day18-presunset.jpg" alt="" width="80%"/>
<p style="text-align: center;"><i>I couldn't get enough of this valley, so leaving was a little dissapointing</i></p>

I connected back to the highway as the sun was setting behind the mountains. Even if the sun was setting, I still had some light to work with so I was going to keep going until it was completely dark.

<img src="static/website/bikeTripImages/day18-sunset.jpg" alt="" width="80%"/>
<p style="text-align: center;"><i>There's still some light left after the sun goes down, right?</i></p>

I couldn't find any information about this section online, so I was relying on GPS to figure out where to go. I came across the Coquihalla river, and the old bridge was completely gone. I had no choice but to cross it so I lifted my bike, and waded through the belly high waters to the other side. With the sun down, the only thing that could dry me off was the cool evening breeze. With the sun fully set at this point, the darkness really started to set in so I threw on my headlamp and started looking for camping spots. I knew I wasn't going to make it all the way to Hope, so I settled down for the night in the Coquihalla Provincial Park. I ate the rest of my food, and had some of the best sleep of my life.

## Day 19 - Hope to Chilliwack Lake (80 km)
After the long day yesterday, I was absolutely starving. I got an early start and made my way to Hope. The first bit of this trail went through the Coquihalla Canyon, which included a lot of tunnels and a lot of bridges over some rough waters.

<img src="static/website/bikeTripImages/day19-othellotunnels.jpg" alt="" width="60%"/>
<p style="text-align: center;"><i>My legs were still quite sore from yesterday so having a more mellow morning was nice</i></p>

I got the eggs and pancake breakfast I've been craving for so much of this trip, stocked up on food for the remote section ahead, and left Hope towards Chilliwack lake. With the heat and humidity, I biked with no shirt for most of the day, so this encouraged me to find a way to have my backpack off my back. I found a way to get it somewhat secure over my handlebars, and got going again. All of a sudden, my butt didn't hurt at all! It took me until the 19th day to realize that my 25 pound backpack was causing my butt pain. I'll definitely keep this in mind for my next bikepacking trip. With this newfound discovery, I biked pain free down the Silver Skagit Road towards the pass that would take me to Chilliwack lake. The pass took me off the road, and the hardest climb of this trip was underway. The trail was rough and steep, so there was a lot of walking. I was travelling at a snails pace for most of the climb, and it took me an hour to do 5 km at one point. This part of the trail was pretty remote, and I didn't see signs of people for a couple of hours, so I played my music loudly to let wildlife know I was passing through. Just as I ran out of water, I came across a mountain runoff stream which gave me a great spot to fill up my water, rest, and soak my shirt before getting going again. The trail was quite worn and overgrown, and I was getting whacked by lots of bushes. Going through one of these overgrown sections, I heard rustling just beside the trail, and a few moments after I passed the rustling, two cougars came out of the bush and onto the trail about 20 meters behind me. I freaked the hell out at first, screamed a little, and tried to bike away, but they kept following. So I calmed myself down, and realized I was doing exactly what you aren't supposed to do when encountering cougars. I got my bearspray ready, got off my bike, faced them, and talked at them instead of screaming. It worked! They stopped almost instantly, which gave me time to back off slowly and get some distance between me and the cougars. When I was about 40 meters away, they hopped back into the bush. The next 15 minutes were some of the most nervewracking minutes of my life, as I was trying to get more distance, make noise, and listen for any signs of them. After more climbing, I made it to the top of the pass!

<p style="text-align: center;"><i>Looking back at the valley I just climbed through</i></p>

The downhill section of the pass was built for a mountain bike without 50 pounds of bags, so I rode what I could, but had to walk some of the sections. It eventually kicked me out onto a logging road, and I saw signs of civilization which was a relief after being so remote for the past 6 hours.

<img src="static/website/bikeTripImages/day19-valleyforward.jpg" alt="" width="70%"/>
<p style="text-align: center;"><i>Looking towards the end of the pass</i></p>

I lost all of the elevation from the pass in about 20 minutes of biking down this road and ended up on the shore of Chilliwack Lake. I made my way to the north side of the lake, took a short swim, and set up camp. Exhausted from the climbing and adrenaline, I didn't notice my e-reader on the floor of the tent when I went to sit down. I wouldn't be reading for the rest of the trip :(

## Day 20 - Chilliwack Lake to Abbotsford (97 km)
I knew I was nearing the end of the trip so I took extra time this morning to soak in the scenery at my campsite before packing up my bike.

<p style="text-align: center;"><i>The bike all packed up and ready to go for day 20</i></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><i>This creek was so nice to sleep next to</i></p>

The first half of the day involved a lot of pushing my bike up hills and having my arms and legs brushed by poison ivy. The trail wound back and forth across the road connecting Chilliwack Lake with Cultus Lake, so for a few of the more overgrown sections, I just took the road. Eventually, I got to a fire road which involved much less poison ivy, and it took me to the town of Cultus Lake. That was pretty much it for the 'wilderness' part of this trip. The rest of the trail would take me through pathways in Abbotsford and the greater Vancouver area. I got some lasagna, then booked a bnb in Abbotsford. I didn't take any pictures for the rest of the day, I was just set on getting to Abbotsford. As I was biking underneath some high voltage power lines, I started getting zapped through the metal parts on my bike, which was a little spooky. Other than that, the trail took me through a bunch of parks and farms until I reached Abbotsford.

## Day 21 - Abbotsford to Vancouver (115 km)
The last day! I knew there was a long day ahead so I started early, and got a big breakfast as I was leaving Abbotsford. I passed a fruit stand right after breakfast and I couldn't turn it down. When I told the girl at the fruit stand what I was doing, she packed an extra box of fruit free of charge for me!

<p style="text-align: center;"><i>Fruit2go</i></p>

I continued north towards Fort Langley, then across the Frasier to Coquitlam. In Coquitlam, I saw their resident black bears about 100 meters down the trail. I chatted with another biker and she said they live here and don't bother anyone. I waited until they went back into the bush and continued on. I got a little lost at Port Moody with the trail being blocked by construction, but found my way back eventually. I started running into derailleur issues with about 20 km to go. The clutch mechanism wasn't working properly so the chain wasn't tensioned. Luckily, I was on a road for the rest of the trip so the chain slap wouldn't be too much of an issue.

<p style="text-align: center;"><i>I was worried I was going to run into nuclear weapons here, good thing they are nuclear weapon free</i></p>

I got to the city limits of Vancouver and followed the TCT markers all the way to Stanley Park. I biked around the park for a bit, and decided I would call it the end of the trip at Prospect Point.

<img src="static/website/bikeTripImages/day21-madeit.jpg" alt="" width="60%"/>
<p style="text-align: center;"><i>Made it!!!</i></p>

This was it! After 21 days and a lot of uncertainty, the trip was complete! I took a while to relax and savour the moment before heading back downtown to check into the hotel. My friend drove over from Calgary so we spent a couple of nights in Vancouver before driving back home. Looking back, I got extremely lucky many times during the trip, so I am so happy that I was able to complete it. I am looking forward to doing more trips like these in the future!
