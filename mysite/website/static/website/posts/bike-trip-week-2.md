# Biking from Calgary to Vancouver - Week 2

## Day 8 - Kikomun Creek Prov. Park to Cranbrook (75 km)
At this point in the trip, I was still considering quitting due to the smoke. It wasn't too bad where I was but it was only going to get worse as I got further into BC. I wasn't sure where I was going to draw the line so I just packed up and got going in the morning. The first 15 kilometers of the day went super quick since it was on the road. I was really craving coffee this morning and luckily, there was a campsite with a general store along the road where I could pick some up. I was really hoping that there would be a store at Wardner, halfway between my start and end point of the day, but unfortunately there wasn't. I have never craved sweet drinks more than I have during this trip.

<p style="text-align: center;"><i>I was trying not to think about how much more I had left in the day but the kilometer markers along this trail told me exactly how far I went every 4 minutes</i></p>
I ran into a couple of bikepackers going the opposite way as me, and they told me the smoke wasn't too bad up ahead, so my hopes for the rest of the trip were raised! The Chief Isadore trail was a fun detour with a mellow climb followed by a fast and flowy descent.

The day was pretty uneventful otherwise, I had an early stop at Cranbrook and relaxed in a hotel for the rest of the evening, and watched some Olympics.

## Day 9 - Cranbrook to Some Bridge close to St Mary Lake (70 km)
The best part of sleeping in motels was not the warm bed, or the AC, or the shower. The best part of sleeping in motels was having your bike packed right when you wake up. Even when I was hustling, packing took me at least an hour. So after a nice complementary breakfast, I was out nice and early and on my way to Kimberley. The Cranbrook to Kimberley pathway was an old railgrade that is now paved over, so even though I was climbing, a 1% grade is hardly noticable

<img src="static/website/bikeTripImages/day9-bike.jpg" alt="" width="80%"/>
<p style="text-align: center;"><i>I'm sure there are more mountains you can't see in the background</i></p>

The smoke got much much worse today so I was taking lots of pictures thinking it could be the end of the trip.

<img src="static/website/bikeTripImages/day9-sudowoodo.jpg" alt="" width="50%"/>
<p style="text-align: center;"><i>Sudowoodo!</i></p>

I was very indecisive about whether or not to continue once I got to Kimberley, so I took a lunch break to think about it. I decided that as long as I am taking it easy and the smoke isn't bothering me, I would keep going. Me mum did not like that choice very much but I think it was the right one.

<img src="static/website/bikeTripImages/day9-graycreekpass.jpg" alt="" width="60%"/>
<p style="text-align: center;"><i>I guess I'm an adventurous person!</i></p>

After leaving Kimberley, the Gray Creek Pass begins! This infamous section of the trail climbs over 1400m, but I knew I wasn't going to tackle it today. I took it slow for the rest of the day and stopped for a snack at the very windy St Mary Lake.

After this break, I went for another hour till I found the perfect campsite next to a creek. There were a couple of campers set up nearby as well. The hammock was once again well worth it as I had some tea while reading as dusk set in.

## Day 10 - Some Bridge close to St Mary Lake to Kokanee Creek Prov. Park (80 km)
After a good rest, I felt ready to tackle Gray Creek Pass. As I was packing my bags up in the morning, I noticed a biker going up the pass as well. I rushed to finish packing and biked quickly up the first bit of the pass. I eventually caught up and we chatted for a bit. His name was Sean and he was in Calgary for the stampede. Instead of driving back with his partner, he decided to take it as an opportunity to do the TCT from Banff to Vancouver. We continued up the pass together, which was made a little easier with company.

<img src="static/website/bikeTripImages/day10-creek.jpg" alt="" width="60%"/>
<p style="text-align: center;"><i>There were lots of spots to fill up water along the road</i></p>
After 3 hours of some biking and some bike pushing, we made it to the top! I took a longer break to have some lunch while Sean continued down the other side of the pass. While eating lunch, a couple more bikepackers came up the other end of the pass! We had lunch together, and I was a little jealous of their jerky and avocado wraps. We told each other about the trails ahead and what to expect. Seeing all these bikepackers made me incredibly confident in the rest of the journey.

The ride down the pass was incredibly fast. I covered 25 kilometers in under an hour, and lost all the elevation I worked so hard to gain.

I took a long break at Crawford Bay to eat some early dinner and read for a couple of hours. After this break, I made my way to the free Ferry across Kootenay Lake.

<p style="text-align: center;"><i>The view across the lake was blocked by smoke, so the ferry looked like it came out of nowhere</i></p>

I found another provincial park along the way, and once again, the showers and bear lockers were well worth the cost of a site.

## Day 11 - Kokanee Creek Prov. Park to Trail (110 km)
I got an early start to the day, and with the paved road between me and Nelson, I covered ground quickly. Biking on the shoulder of the road got to be a little unnerving as the road was quite windy, but most drivers slowed down and gave lots of room as they passed.

<img src="static/website/bikeTripImages/day11-nelson.jpg" alt="" width="60%"/>
<p style="text-align: center;"><i>This road is a lot steeper than it looks!</i></p>

I was in Nelson the year before as part of a road trip and it was one of my favorite towns, so I was excited to have made it there. I stopped at a cafe for breakfast and took extra time to bike through downtown Nelson after I was done. The TCT took me through the steep hills of Nelson and onto another section of railgrade trail. Once again, even though I was climbing, the 1% grade was hardly noticable. 

<img src="static/website/bikeTripImages/day11-pond.jpg" alt="" width="60%"/>
<p style="text-align: center;"><i>A bit of smoke</i></p>

There were plenty of ponds and wetlands along this section of the trail, which made the air noticably humid. That paired with the heat made getting to Salmo a bit of a slog. After getting to Salmo, I went straight to the cafe to get some late lunch and a cold drink. The cafe was packed with people in some interesting clothes, so I did some googling while waiting for my food and found that the Shambhala music festival just south of Salmo ended that afternoon. If only I made it to Salmo two days earlier.

<p style="text-align: center;"><i>Dome shaped home</i></p>

The long lunches I've been taking turned into a pattern, even if I didn't realize it before today. With the high temperatues during this trip, biking from 2 to 4 pm is pretty much impossible, so I've just been using those hours to rest instead.

After Salmo, a lot of the TCT went along the shoulder of the highway or minor paved roads, which allowed me to cover a lot of distance. This was the first day that I felt that my fitness was improving, so the extra distance didn't feel too difficult. I got a motel in Trail, ordered a pizza, and watched some TV before crashing after a long day.

## Day 12 - Trail to Christina Lake (100 km)
After closely watching the smoke forecast, I decided it would be best to not follow the TCT and go through Castlegar. Instead, I planned to go through Rossland and reconnect with the TCT at Paulson. The smoke was quite bad in Trail this morning as well so I biked most of the morning with a mask on.

<img src="static/website/bikeTripImages/day12-trail.jpg" alt="" width="60%"/>
<p style="text-align: center;"><i>I got a little lost looking for the right way through these trails</i></p>

12 km from Trail, I got to Rossland. Right at the edge of the town, someone was standing on their balcony and waved. We talked for a bit and she told me the best way to get into the city that avoided any steep hills. In town, I stocked up on food.

<img src="static/website/bikeTripImages/day12-jarold.jpg" alt="" width="60%"/>
<p style="text-align: center;"><i>I made sure to keep my eyes out for the rest of the trip</i></p>

Unfortunately, this alternate route included more than 50km of biking on the shoulder on a road that was not too quiet. I grit my teeth through most of the road biking since I wanted to get it done with as soon as possible.

<img src="static/website/bikeTripImages/day12-summit.jpg" alt="" width="80%"/>
<p style="text-align: center;"><i>It was Sunday, so the roads were a bit busy for my liking</i></p>

After two passes and almost a kilometer of climbing, I reconnected with the TCT. I found an old campsite to take a break at and sat around for a couple of hours.

<img src="static/website/bikeTripImages/day12-breakspot.jpg" alt="" width="80%"/>
<p style="text-align: center;"><i>This would've been a perfect place to stop, but I wanted to make more distance while the sun was up</i></p>

Just as I was leaving, another bikepacker pulled up to this spot to spend the night. He came from Castlegar and said the smoke was manageable. The rest of the day had some pretty easy biking, it was downhill at a shallow grade so I could pedal lightly and still travel quick.

<img src="static/website/bikeTripImages/day12-sunset.jpg" alt="" width="60%"/>
<p style="text-align: center;"><i>Sunset over Christina Lake</i></p>

After the long break earlier in the day I felt energetic so I kept biking along until sunset was near, then I started looking out for campsites. I found a nice spot near Cascade Falls where I found a nice and sandy spot. By the time I was done setting up, it was almost completely dark out, my timing was perfect!

## Day 13 - Christina Lake to Rock Creek (98 km)
I woke up with a huge headache, feeling like I barely slept at all. I'm fortunate enough to rarely get headaches and I'm fortunate enough to have my headaches removed quickly when I take tylenol. I took some while packing up, but by the time I was finished, the headache only got worse. Well, there was nothing to do but keep 'er going. I drank some extra water and took it very easy this morning. While biking along, my front wheel felt like it kept washing out, even though the gravel trail was packed well. It took me longer than I'd like to admit to figure out that I had a flat on my front wheel! I had service and plenty of tools, so after some searching I figured out that tubeless sealant can lose effectiveness with time. I put some new sealant in the tire and I was good to go. I made it to Grand Forks, just a little bit too late to get the eggs and bacon breakfast I was craving, so I ordered a chicken sandwich instead. I almost passed out while waiting for the food, I made it to my chair before my vision went completely dark. I took a breather, got it together, then went back to the coffee stand to dump a ton of sugar into my cup. This made me feel much better. The sandwich revived me a little as well, but I still didn't feel 100%.

<p style="text-align: center;"><i>Looking out onto the farmland north of Grand Forks</i></p>

I continued slowly and steadily out of Grand Forks and about 20 km later, I stumbled upon this old shed.

<img src="static/website/bikeTripImages/day13-shed.jpg" alt="" width="60%"/>
<p style="text-align: center;"><i>A great place to take a break from the sun</i></p>

Since I wasn't feeling too great, I took an hour to relax in the shed and read before continuing again. A biker came by and joined me for a bit. He lived in Grand Forks and we exchanged stories for a while until he needed to head back home. I stayed a little longer then got back to it.

<p style="text-align: center;"><i>A mud dauber wasp was pestering me while I was trying to read in here</i></p>

I went through the first tunnel of the trip right after the shed. They were always a little spooky, but ultimately fun.

<img src="static/website/bikeTripImages/day13-traillog.jpg" alt="" width="60%"/>
<p style="text-align: center;"><i>There were lots of trail logs along the TCT with plenty of information for trail users and logs that usually went back at least 10 years</i></p>

The morning was a bit of a blur but in the late afternoon I started to feel much better. I was going to stop in Greenwood but decided to press on until my legs got too tired or it got too dark.

<img src="static/website/bikeTripImages/day13-green.jpg" alt="" width="80%"/>
<p style="text-align: center;"><i>So green!</i></p>

I was running into a lot of dogs along this stretch, but all of them were friendly and joined me in my journey for a minute or so.

<img src="static/website/bikeTripImages/day13-deer.jpg" alt="" width="80%"/>
<p style="text-align: center;"><i>Bit of a late reaction for this deer</i></p>

About 20 km out of Greenwood, I started to keep my eyes out for camp sites. All the land here was private and I prefered a spot on crown land. So I kept going and got off my bike to scope out sites every now and then.

<p style="text-align: center;"><i>Official start of the Kettle Valley Rail Trail - 500 kilometers of wide, low grade trails</i></p>

I got to the town of Rock Creek by the time the sun was completely set. There was a motel with a pub that I was very tempted to drop a bunch of money at, but I got a motel not long ago and couldn't justify it. There was also a campsite but it appeared to be full. So I put on my headlamp and kept going. The trail went along a creek, and I eventually found a path that led down to the creek and dragged my bike down. After all the dust from the trail today, I had to take a dunk in the creek, so I got that over with before unpacking my bike and setting up camp. It was pitch black out by the time I was done setting up camp and eating, so setting up the bear hang was a bit of a challenge.

## Day 14 - Rock Creek to Arlington Lakes (80 km)
After the headachey day yesterday, I set out to have a slower more relaxing day today. I slept a little longer, and took my sweet time packing up. The sleeping pad I brought was holding up quite well, the rocky riverbank did not bother me at all while I was sleeping.

<img src="static/website/bikeTripImages/day14-morning.jpg" alt="" width="80%"/>
<p style="text-align: center;"><i>Definitely not camping on private property</i></p>

Luckily, whatever was bothering me yesterday passed, and I was feeling great this morning. I was just craving real food so I set my sights on Beaverdell, roughly 50km from where I camped. The heat was back today, and a lot of this valley was burned by a fire a few years ago, so there was little shade.

<img src="static/website/bikeTripImages/day14-road.jpg" alt="" width="80%"/>
<p style="text-align: center;"><i>The smoke was looking like it would clear up a bit</i></p>

Eventually, I made it out of the fire affected zone and to my relief, it was much cooler. My back wheel went over a stick and I couldn't pedal anymore. I got flashbacks of the second day of the trip. Luckily the stick just bent my derailleur cage, so it was easily fixable. After adjusting the derailleur cable a bit, the bike was shifting like new again.

<img src="static/website/bikeTripImages/day14-beaverdell.jpg" alt="" width="80%"/>
<p style="text-align: center;"><i>The pizza shop in Beaverdell</i></p>

I went straight for the pizza shop when I got into Beaverdell, drank two cans of pop, and I was feeling ready to go again. I was originally planning on staying in Beaverdell but there were only RV's in the campsite and I didn't want to spend the rest of the day sitting around in a town so I decided to keep going. Arlington Lakes was along the trail and they had camping so I made that my goal. Before leaving the town, I stopped by the general store to stock up on snacks. They had 50 cent icecream so I got one for the road.

<img src="static/website/bikeTripImages/day14-bigwhite.jpg" alt="" width="60%"/>
<p style="text-align: center;"><i>I should've brought skis</i></p>

The smoke cleared a little bit in the afternoon so the views of the valley were back. The consecutive long days on the bike were starting to make my butt quite sore so I was taking a lot of breaks. Pro-tip: don't wear a 25 pound backpack if you're planning on biking for several hours. It took me until the 19<sup>th</sup> day to realize this.

<img src="static/website/bikeTripImages/day14-campsite.jpg" alt="" width="80%"/>
<p style="text-align: center;"><i>This was one of my favorite camp spots of the trip, I had a great spot to hang the hammock on the two trees on the right side</i></p>

I got to Arlington lakes, and got to work on the pepperoni, chips, chocolate, and peanutbutter I bought in Beaverdell for dinner. The campsite warden came by with his dog which I got to pet while he was getting my change for the site. After the heat of the day, the lake felt amazing to swim in. I floated around for half an hour before going back to my site to read in the hammock.
